### Project: AddressBook Level 3

AddressBook - Level 3 is a desktop category book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to undo/redo previous commands.
  * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()
  * Add book
  * Correctly referencing commands to book-releated features
  * Migration of Duke to JavaFX

* **Project management**:
  * Project Lead - Managed project team progress as well as direction on what needs to be done

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Provided base template for user guide to be worked upon
  * Developer Guide:
    * Provided base template for user guide to be worked upon
